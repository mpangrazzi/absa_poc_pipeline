This Sucker SUCKS!,5,"I just received this vacuum a few hours ago, but I dove right in. Right out of the box it was super easy to assemble. The only time I looked at the instruction book was to learn what the height adjustments meant. And it’s a good thing I did because even on the middle (3) setting, it tried to eat a couple of my throw rugs it’s so powerful. So, on to the test drive. I ran my new Bissell over an area that I had just vacuumed yesterday with a “stick” type vacuum. It was easy to maneuver - not heavy and the swivel action was pretty cool (first time with a vacuum that swivels : ) and boy, did this thing suck. I was embarrassed to see how much dirt and dog hair it picked up from an area I thought was “clean”. Dumping the dirt was so easy. I’m used to getting more on me than in the trash. But not with this dirt canister. Even using the attachments was a breeze. I cannot attest to how it will work on a high pile carpet as I don’t have one. But with the demo it gave me today, my guess is that it will work great. The instructions that came with the Bissell showed me not only how to assemble and use the vacuum, it also shows how to clean and maintain it including how to change the belt when/if necessary. And the directions were so clear and easy to follow that even I could figure them out. I suspect I will have this machine for a long time. The bottom line is, if you have dirt (who doesn’t) get this vacuum but especially if you have pets that shed. It really does a great job!"
"Worth the money, does what it says it will.",5,"My older vacuum was also a Bissell, a Bissell pet rewind. Purple and green colored with a clear canister, Retractable cord, amazing suction....just couldn't find filters anymore. Bought this particular (new to me) pet hair vacuum, it doesn't have the auto cord rewind, (sucky,) but, it has the most amazing swivel that works so easily, especially for those with bad or weak wrists. Would be great for older people or anyone with wrist issues (like myself-carpal tunnel, arthritis). Feels extremely light weight when pushing and pulling as long as the carpet height setting is correct. The detachable hose/handle is perfect for reaching things on the ceiling or the furthest corners behind and under things...the pet hair attachment is a gift (to be honest), because it actually works!!! The last few vacuums I've owned came with a pet hair attachment and within the first three or four uses  it became tangled up and nasty (even with frequent cleanings,) the hair just got so caught up in it, that the rubber spinny thing stopped spinning. If you know what I mean. 😆 Not sure of the exact terminology, ...obviously. 😂 I did purchase more filters for not only the canister but the motor as well. Funny side note, the reason I bought the new vacuum was because I couldn't find filters for my old one. The filters I bought separately for the new vacuum, (to avoid running out and not finding them later...again...lol.....) were the exact same filters my old vacuum used!!!. So now I have 2 vacuums and filters for both! (Full disclosure: I didn't really look for more filters for the old vacuum because I wanted a new one...... 😂!) Well, now I have an indoor one for carpet with the fancy febreeze filter, and an indoor/outdoor one I use for plant dirt/dust, and cat litter spills, & cleaning out the cars, etc. Not the best vacuum I've ever used, however, this one is absolutely awesome for the purpose intended and the price point!"
Best vacuum for the price!,5,"I am absolutely amazed with this vacuum, I’m an engineer and can tell a lot of thought went into this machine when they designed it. Very impressive how they have kept the motor noise down while the suction power has gone up. You will be hard pressed to find any vacuum this well designed and so functional at this price. Good job Bissell!"
Mostly Fantastic. Awesome performance.,5,"My old vac broke. I bought a Shark but when it arrived I found that it only had a 9.5"" suck hole so I returned it. I got the Bissell 3198A because it has the widest suck hole available (13"") and the biggest bagless bag available (1 liter). Assembly was easy. In the first 3 feet of vacuuming it picked up a shocking amount of rug fuzz. It's performance is awesome. Maneuverability is awesome with the swivel feature. The only negative is the layout of the hose and cord is a little annoying. But this is a small negative. Otherwise big thumbs up for the Bissell 3198a. UPDATE; I've had it now for a couple of days and have vacuumed several rooms. Embarrassed to say that this thing is so awesome that i enjoy vacuuming. There are see through windows on the beater brush and the dirt container, and seeing how much dust and dirt it accumulates makes it fun. The pullout wand is awesome too. Really easy to use."
Extreme suction,5,"I vacum at least 3 times a week if not more! I could not believe the dust and dirt this vacum picked up geeze!!!You think your home is clean!Its nit real heavy it maneuvers well,really happy with my purchase!If your a pet owner get it you will not be disappointed,its my girls shedding season and I'm glad I have this to clean with!"
Great vaccum for the price,5,Such great suction on this vacuum. It manages to pickup so much first and hair from my carpets
Great vacuum!,4,"I've been using mine for a few months. I love the swivel maneuvering, suction, and the way the whole handle detaches to have a long reach to suction the cracks and crevices high/low. The canister is if adequate size and easy to empty. I wish it had lights for better visibility. The attached tool is clever to serve as fine suction and a brush in one, but the brush size is  too small for efficient use. The lower cord is a decent length and gets around without having to continually move it. The height levels for carpet are good. I dislike that the main floor vacuum continues as you use the handle for detailed suctioning. If you aren't careful, it will eat your carpet while you vacuum the couch (or whatever). You have to hold it tipped slightly to prevent this, all the while using the machines machine. Sound level is good. It's on the heavier side for going up and down stairs."
Great Vacuum for the price!,5,Sucked a lot of pet hair out of my carpets. Happy with the purchase.
Pretty good,5,I like deep cleaning and this vacuum allows that for sure. Has great suction and the attachments work well. It seems a little on the heavy side but it’s alright. Fluffs up the carpet nicely and easy to keep clean.
Love Bissell products,5,Love the maneuverability. This is my second Pet vacuum but this one doesn’t have cord rewind. I wish I had this feature again.
Bissell CleanView Swivel Pet Reach Vacuum Cleaner,5,"Easy to assemble, and emptying tank is straight forward. Used it to vacuum 1 room, and it filled the tank twice. Very impressed, awesome suction. Hopefully it will last, but so far-so good."
Finally!,5,"I have two cats and an Australian Shepherd who sheds a ton of hair if you just look at him.  I had rolled up an expensive hall runner because I couldn’t keep it clean enough, even with a high end Eureka, so I used that as a test.  The runner had been vacuumed with the Eureka before being banished to the closet.  A few minutes vacuuming with the Bissell and it picked up enough dog hair to almost fill the dirt tank.  With that success, I vacuumed carpets, rugs, and bare floor, emptying the tank at least 5 times.  And my apartment is only 1300 sq feet!  This one’s a keeper!"
Does the job,4,"Very good budget vacuum. Cleans very well. Does not fit under the couch and I did not think to get a retractable cord, I wish I had. But over all, its a very good vacuum cleaner. Sucked ups a cup of dirt in seconds that I robot left behind."
Great Vaccum!,5,This vacuum works exactly like I wanted it to.  It picks up everything.
It's a good tool of you have pets,5,It gets up the dirt and hair with no problem. It light and easy to push around.
Great,5,I friggen love this thing. A great purchase
Picks up dog hair on all surfaces,5,"Good suction, picks up dog hair, dirt, hay, etc. Easy to empty canister. Easy to clean filter. Does get clogged, but easy to take apart and unclog, takes no time at all."
Great value,5,I love this.  I have 2 dogs and it doesn't clog up. Fantastic. Best vacuum I've owned
I LOVE THIS VACUUM,5,"I ripped open the box literally 15 minutes ago and started vacuuming because I was so excited. What you see in the picture is the result of my living room and an area rug in my dining room. Neither of those spaces are large, but look at what the vacuum picked up! I just vacuumed both areas yesterday and only live with 1 cat, so what youre seeing is what wasn't getting sucked up before. I've been using Bissell vacuums exclusively for 2 years now and they're the best. This was to replace a Bissell CleanView Pet Slim that had a roller that was getting shredded on the side (had 2 of them, they both did that, don't recommend them). I have an older similar model of this vacuum that stays upstairs and gets used regularly, and it's lasted for 2 years with no issues. This is a no frills vacuum, very basic, but far better than the Hoover or Dyson I had in the past. It will be used everyday. Imo, regular vacuums are the way to go, not the stupid stick/slim ones. If you look in the picture, the carpet pile isn't too high and I left the vacuum at the level 3 for the height adjustment. It's a great vacuum, not too heavy, and picks up a LOT. Just buy it, you'll be happy you did!"
Great but needs a few items to be better,4,"Overall, for the price point this is a great vacuum cleaner. Things that are missing is retractable electrical cord. The cord is manurey placed on the side of the vacuum and there is nowhere to hold the cord up out of your way when using the vacuum. This vacuum does not have a front facing light. The other pet peeve is the muti function hose attachment which functions as a nozzle or a brush. When using the nozzle only function there is no way to keep the brush from sliding down and getting in the way. All the above mentioned are no deal breakers but could have make this a five-star vacuum cleaner instead of a four star."
From a Shark to a Bissell!!!,5,"I was a shark believer, and i still like their vacuums.  But after having to replace ours 3 times in the last 5 years, it was time to try something different.  This vacuum has surpassed my expectations and i love it.  i hope it lasts forever!"
Excellent appliance,5,This vacuum is so great even the cleaning lady raves about it.  She has a vacuum but only uses ours.
Actually works just like they claim !,5,"Finally - a product that does exactly what the manufacturers claim.... dog hair, cat hair, mystery gunk (eww) Whatever I track in from the barn.... it picks it up.  It even does edges and corners. The canister is easy to empty and no touching the mystery gunk.  They were a bit optimistic perhaps with the term ""lightweight"" - no it is not.  But, it's perfect for this farmhouse, so I'll carry it up the stairs!"
Good purchase,4,No complaints with purchase
Práctica y eficiente,4,"Trabaja muy bien, fácil de limpiar los filtros, no es muy liviana pero no afecta al trabajar bonito color"
Great value for the price,5,
Best vac for pet hair,5,"I got this vacuum thinking I was just getting a mediocre product for a low price. However, I am very impressed by its performance. I briefly tried it out on a section of my rug, and was shocked by how much fur it actually picked up. It's relatively light weight, but still a little cumbersome to move up and down stairs. Overall I think it's a great vacuum for the price, and this particular one works great if you have furry pets."
I asked for a vacuum cleaner not sheet sucker,4,Works great on pet hair
Bissell... Dog hair... Bissell WON!!!,5,"It has great suction but when it started to suck my sheet up it started to smoke a little, luckily the sheet was very easy to remove. The smoke stopped and most like was from the friction of the sheet."
A little clunky but amazing for pet hair,5,I love this vacuum! I have a Great Pyrenees. Hair everywhere is normal everyday life. I'm so excited I finally found a vacuum that can keep up with our dog! Easily worth twice what I paid for it! But very thankful I didn't have too! Not great for steps but I don't have any! Thanks Bissell for making a great product!

Picks up dog hair on all surfaces,5,"Good suction, picks up dog hair, dirt, hay, etc. Easy to empty canister. Easy to clean filter. Does get clogged, but easy to take apart and unclog, takes no time at all."
Great value,5,I love this.  I have 2 dogs and it doesn't clog up. Fantastic. Best vacuum I've owned
I LOVE THIS VACUUM,5,"I ripped open the box literally 15 minutes ago and started vacuuming because I was so excited. What you see in the picture is the result of my living room and an area rug in my dining room. Neither of those spaces are large, but look at what the vacuum picked up! I just vacuumed both areas yesterday and only live with 1 cat, so what youre seeing is what wasn't getting sucked up before. I've been using Bissell vacuums exclusively for 2 years now and they're the best. This was to replace a Bissell CleanView Pet Slim that had a roller that was getting shredded on the side (had 2 of them, they both did that, don't recommend them). I have an older similar model of this vacuum that stays upstairs and gets used regularly, and it's lasted for 2 years with no issues. This is a no frills vacuum, very basic, but far better than the Hoover or Dyson I had in the past. It will be used everyday. Imo, regular vacuums are the way to go, not the stupid stick/slim ones. If you look in the picture, the carpet pile isn't too high and I left the vacuum at the level 3 for the height adjustment. It's a great vacuum, not too heavy, and picks up a LOT. Just buy it, you'll be happy you did!"
Great but needs a few items to be better,4,"Overall, for the price point this is a great vacuum cleaner. Things that are missing is retractable electrical cord. The cord is manurey placed on the side of the vacuum and there is nowhere to hold the cord up out of your way when using the vacuum. This vacuum does not have a front facing light. The other pet peeve is the muti function hose attachment which functions as a nozzle or a brush. When using the nozzle only function there is no way to keep the brush from sliding down and getting in the way. All the above mentioned are no deal breakers but could have make this a five-star vacuum cleaner instead of a four star."
From a Shark to a Bissell!!!,5,"I was a shark believer, and i still like their vacuums.  But after having to replace ours 3 times in the last 5 years, it was time to try something different.  This vacuum has surpassed my expectations and i love it.  i hope it lasts forever!"
Not bad but keeps shocking me,3,I love this vacuum I just got it today but it keeps shocking me? I think I might need to return it because it really hurts when it shocks me I can’t even vacuum a full room without turning it off because it’s hurting so bad..
Actually works just like they claim !,5,"Finally - a product that does exactly what the manufacturers claim.... dog hair, cat hair, mystery gunk (eww) Whatever I track in from the barn.... it picks it up.  It even does edges and corners. The canister is easy to empty and no touching the mystery gunk.  They were a bit optimistic perhaps with the term ""lightweight"" - no it is not.  But, it's perfect for this farmhouse, so I'll carry it up the stairs!"
Excellent appliance,5,This vacuum is so great even the cleaning lady raves about it.  She has a vacuum but only uses ours.
Good purchase,4,No complaints with purchase
Práctica y eficiente,4,"Trabaja muy bien, fácil de limpiar los filtros, no es muy liviana pero no afecta al trabajar bonito color"
Great value for the price,5,
Best vac for pet hair,5,"I got this vacuum thinking I was just getting a mediocre product for a low price. However, I am very impressed by its performance. I briefly tried it out on a section of my rug, and was shocked by how much fur it actually picked up. It's relatively light weight, but still a little cumbersome to move up and down stairs. Overall I think it's a great vacuum for the price, and this particular one works great if you have furry pets."
I asked for a vacuum cleaner not sheet sucker,4,Works great on pet hair
Suction not the best.,3,"It has great suction but when it started to suck my sheet up it started to smoke a little, luckily the sheet was very easy to remove. The smoke stopped and most like was from the friction of the sheet."
